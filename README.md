ThreeGeoJSON
=======================

This project aims to be a simple way to render geojson data in 3D with three.js.
Work in progress...

Currently, you can create ThreeGeo objects with var x = new ThreeGeo.Layer(json, radius, {options}), then render them with x.drawGeometry();. This creates a geoJson object on a sphere. See ThreeGeoJSON.html for a complete example.
