ThreeGeoJSON
=======================

This project aims to be a simple way to render geojson data in 3D with three.js.
Work in progress...

Currently, you can render geojson as lines on a flat plane by calling processGeoJSON(geoJSON_object, plane_size). 

Notes:
Plane size works best if set at 10 for now. 
The geojson must be contained in a feature collection. Geometry collections are currently not supported.
