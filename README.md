ThreeGeoJSON
=======================

This project aims to be a simple way to render geojson data in 3D with three.js.
Work in progress...

Currently, you can render geojson on a sphere by calling drawOnSphere(geoJSON_object, sphere_radius), or on a plane by calling drawOnPlane(geoJSON_object, plane_size). 

Notes:
The geojson must be contained in a feature collection. Geometry collections are currently not supported.
